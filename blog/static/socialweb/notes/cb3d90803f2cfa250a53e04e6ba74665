But what if we could flip the script? What if badges could be decentralized, self-certified, and issued directly by organizations in the Fediverse?\nBy reusing the social graph already present in the Fediverse, we can enable a seamless integration of badges into the networks people are already part of. Instead of creating new, siloed systems for certification, we can utilize the trusted connections and relationships within platforms like Mastodon to issue and verify badges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull article by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://hachyderm.io/users/mapache\u0022 class=\u0022u-url mention\u0022\u003E@\u003Cspan\u003Emapache\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0027https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/01-init/\u0027\u003Ehttps://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/01-init/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
