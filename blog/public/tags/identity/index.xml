      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;br&gt;
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-bits-of-decentralization&#34;&gt;Early Bits of Decentralization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re planning to add &lt;strong&gt;two more test instances&lt;/strong&gt; to push federation further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said—&lt;strong&gt;there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting&lt;/strong&gt; yet. So we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the wild west).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋<br>
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="early-bits-of-decentralization">Early Bits of Decentralization</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&rsquo;re planning to add <strong>two more test instances</strong> to push federation further.</p>
<p>That said—<strong>there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting</strong> yet. So we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&rsquo;t ready for the wild west).</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>—if you&rsquo;re comfortable around <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>, <strong>don&rsquo;t mind losing data</strong>, and want to help us test the early messy bits, <strong>let us know</strong>! We&rsquo;d love to have more fearless testers on board.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="openbadges-export-is-live-">OpenBadges Export is Live! 🎉</h2>
<p>Big milestone: <strong>you can now export your badges to OpenBadges format!</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge step toward real portability. Right now, you can only export badges tied to <strong>profile URLs</strong> (think Mastodon profiles, etc.), <em>not emails</em> yet.</p>
<p>That means you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> directly import them into platforms like <strong>Badgr</strong> or <strong>Credly</strong> (unless they someday support URL-based verification).<br>
We&rsquo;re going to push for that—because identity shouldn&rsquo;t be chained to an email address.</p>
<p>Also: <strong>we have zero interest in storing emails</strong>. Privacy first. Always.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="uxui-improvements--search-">UX/UI Improvements + Search 🔍</h2>
<p>A few small but mighty improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New search page</strong>! Now you can search your past badges easily.</li>
<li><strong>Badges are now an attachment to a regular ActivityPub note</strong>, instead of a separate document type.
<ul>
<li>We tried doing a new document type, but&hellip; <em>Mastodon just ignored it.</em></li>
<li>Like it or not, we need to be Mastodon-compatible to reach people. But attachments are a <strong>fine</strong> way to extend the ActivityPub spec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Little things, but they add up to a smoother experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-other-issuers-and-bridgefed">Follow Other Issuers! (and Bridgefed!)</h2>
<p>Issuers can now <strong>follow other issuers</strong>!<br>
We think this is a critical building block for decentralization. 🛠️</p>
<p>Plus, if you follow <strong>Bridgy Fed</strong>, it will <strong>bridge to Bluesky</strong>!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lots-of-other-nerdy-bits">Lots of Other Nerdy Bits</h2>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of minor improvements and cleanups</li>
<li>More internal support for federating badges across different servers</li>
<li>Prepping groundwork for instance-level controls later</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="wanna-test-with-us-">Wanna Test With Us? 🧪</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw SQL</li>
<li>Servers crashing</li>
<li>Maybe losing everything 😅</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and want to help shape early decentralized BadgeFed, <strong>message us</strong>!</p>
<p>(Seriously, it&rsquo;ll be messy but fun.)</p>

      <title>BadgeFed Grows Up (a Little) - April 2025 Update</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/03-april-update/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;br&gt;
Big news—BadgeFed is officially growing out of its prototype phase. This is your periodic (weekly? monthly? vibes-based?) update on what’s new, what’s brewing, and what we need help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-badges-real-people&#34;&gt;Real Badges, Real People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve issued around &lt;strong&gt;25 badges&lt;/strong&gt;—our first batch we consider &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;! 🎉&lt;br&gt;
Out of those, about 10 were accepted. Folks who accepted should’ve received a private notification. If you didn’t, check your inbox or let us know!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Big news—BadgeFed is officially growing out of its prototype phase. This is your periodic (weekly? monthly? vibes-based?) update on what’s new, what’s brewing, and what we need help with.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="real-badges-real-people">Real Badges, Real People</h2>
<p>We’ve issued around <strong>25 badges</strong>—our first batch we consider <em>real</em>! 🎉<br>
Out of those, about 10 were accepted. Folks who accepted should’ve received a private notification. If you didn’t, check your inbox or let us know!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="admin-auth-hashtags--ux-glow-up">Admin Auth, Hashtags &amp; UX Glow-Up</h2>
<p>We added authentication for the admin panel!<br>
Right now, you’ll need to set up a Mastodon server and a unique admin user. That account will manage everything: badges, actors, and more.</p>
<p>We also added <strong>hashtag support</strong>! So badges now show up properly across the fediverse with their tags.<br>
Huge shoutout to <a href="https://dotnet.social/@SmartmanApps">@SmartmanApps@dotnet.social</a>—this one’s for you! And thanks for the reminder: hashtags really are the backbone of fediverse discoverability.</p>
<p>On the visual side—we gave the UI some love! It’s starting to feel like something we’re proud of. If you’re into CSS or design, we’d <em>love</em> to collaborate.</p>
<p>We’re inching toward a private beta launch. Just trying to avoid any irreversible DB/spec changes before opening the doors. (We’ve already nuked the whole database a few times&hellip; classic early days.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="federation--future-thinking">Federation &amp; Future Thinking</h2>
<p>We’re still figuring out federation, we have already a few ideas to implement it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re deep in the weeds of the OpenBadges spec and slowly building out ActivityPub updates (like actor updates, more robust object flows, etc.).</p>
<p>We also started poking at what interop with <strong>at-proto (aka Bluesky)</strong> might look like. We’re skeptical, but curious. If you’ve got thoughts, we’re all ears.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tech-notes--nerdy-bits">Tech Notes &amp; Nerdy Bits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still using <strong>SQLite</strong>—haven’t made the jump to PostgreSQL yet.</li>
<li>We added a (very alpha) settings option to download your DB and run raw SQL. It’s powerful&hellip; and risky. Use with care.</li>
<li>Exploring the idea of <strong>one SQLite DB per actor</strong>, so identities and records can be portable across servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh—and we finally squashed that annoying cache issue showing old badges.<br>
Huge thanks to <a href="https://stefanbohacek.online/@stefan">Stefan Bohacek</a> for the report. We made the badge note ID actually unique now. 🙃</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bug-fixes--shoutouts">Bug Fixes &amp; Shoutouts</h2>
<p>Massive props to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitra.social/@silverpill"><strong>Silver Pill</strong></a> for reporting an issue when following an issuer/actor.</li>
<li><a href="https://a11y.social/@dankeck"><strong>Dan Keck</strong></a> for the awesome a11y PR that added alt-text to badges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep ‘em coming—we appreciate every bug report and contribution.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next-">What’s Next? 📅</h2>
<p>We’re heads-down on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federation polish</li>
<li>Better actor management</li>
<li>OpenBadges support</li>
<li>Prepping for private beta</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an open-source project. If you&rsquo;re into decentralization, badges, identity, or just weird fun tech—<strong>jump in</strong>. Feedback, PRs, issue ideas, and vibes are all welcome.</p>

      <title>BadgeFed: From Prototype to Reality</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/02-roadmap/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse, we&amp;rsquo;ve got some exciting news—BadgeFed is moving out of the prototype phase! That&amp;rsquo;s right, what started as a scrappy proof-of-concept is now becoming a real, structured, and (dare we say) polished federated badge system.
And since we believe in working out in the open, we want to share our roadmap with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-three-priorities-&#34;&gt;The Big Three Priorities 🏆&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re focusing on three major areas to take BadgeFed from &amp;ldquo;hey, this kinda works&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;oh wow, this is actually usable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse, we&rsquo;ve got some exciting news—BadgeFed is moving out of the prototype phase! That&rsquo;s right, what started as a scrappy proof-of-concept is now becoming a real, structured, and (dare we say) polished federated badge system.
And since we believe in working out in the open, we want to share our roadmap with you.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-three-priorities-">The Big Three Priorities 🏆</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re focusing on three major areas to take BadgeFed from &ldquo;hey, this kinda works&rdquo; to &ldquo;oh wow, this is actually usable.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="1-authentication-">1. Authentication 🔐</h3>
<p>Right now, logging in is a bit of a mess. So we&rsquo;re tackling authentication properly, integrating OAuth so you can log in using your Mastodon (or other Fediverse) account.
We&rsquo;re building this with .NET and Blazor because performance and scalability matter. Plus, no one wants to manage yet another username/password combo.</p>
<h3 id="2-federation--spec-">2. Federation &amp; Spec 🌍</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re making sure BadgeFed speaks ActivityPub fluently. Right now, federation kinda-sorta works, but we need to define a proper spec that makes badge issuing,
earning, and verification seamless across different platforms. Whether you&rsquo;re on Mastodon, Pleroma, or something else entirely, BadgeFed should just work.
We&rsquo;re ironing out the kinks so badges travel as smoothly as your cat pictures. Also we want to support export and import from OpenBadges spec, and we need to do some experimentation on how this could travel on the fediverse.</p>
<h3 id="3-packaging-docs-and-docker-">3. Packaging, Docs, and Docker 📦</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s cooler than a decentralized badge system? A decentralized badge system that&rsquo;s easy to set up.
We&rsquo;re working on clear documentation, making installation painless, and putting together a Docker container so you don&rsquo;t have to wrestle with dependencies or even dotnet.
One command, and boom—you&rsquo;re federating badges like a pro.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-would-be-nice-priorities-">The &ldquo;Would Be Nice&rdquo; Priorities ✨</h2>
<p>Once the big three are solid, we&rsquo;re setting our sights on some much-needed improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approval Process &amp; Expiration</strong> – Not all badges should last forever. We&rsquo;re adding controls for expiration dates and approval workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Stats &amp; Insights</strong> – Want to see how many people are earning badges? We&rsquo;ll be adding analytics to track adoption and engagement.</li>
<li><strong>CSS &amp; UI/UX Love</strong> – Let&rsquo;s be honest, the prototype is functional, but it&rsquo;s not winning any beauty contests. Expect smoother UI, better mobile support, and fewer &ldquo;why is this button here?&rdquo; moments.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong> – BadgeFed deserves a proper introduction. A clean, informative landing page is in the works.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next-">What&rsquo;s Next? 📅</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re heads-down working on these priorities, but as always, feedback, ideas, and contributions are welcome.
This is an open-source project, and the best way to make sure it fits the needs of the Fediverse is to have the community involved.</p>
<p>If you want to help, hop into our discussions, check out the repo at <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed">https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed</a>, or just share your thoughts. Let&rsquo;s make federated badges a thing! 🏅</p>
