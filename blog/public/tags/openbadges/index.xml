      <title>BadgeFed Update: Multiple Instances Online!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been quiet… but not idle. Forget waiting for long blog posts, time for micro updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a few BadgeFed instances live and federating! 🏅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it happen, we did a hardcore backend rewrite to support &lt;strong&gt;multiple domains on a single machine&lt;/strong&gt;.
For most, it&amp;rsquo;s a niche cost-saving move, but it might be useful for others too. Under the hood: each domain runs its own SQLite DB, with backups in place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been quiet… but not idle. Forget waiting for long blog posts, time for micro updates.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s news:</p>
<p>We’ve got a few BadgeFed instances live and federating! 🏅</p>
<p>To make it happen, we did a hardcore backend rewrite to support <strong>multiple domains on a single machine</strong>.
For most, it&rsquo;s a niche cost-saving move, but it might be useful for others too. Under the hood: each domain runs its own SQLite DB, with backups in place.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just about the tech, the fun part is seeing multiple BadgeFed servers talking to each other (!!). Follow them, check the thread, boost it, and watch for more as they come online!</p>

      <title>BadgeFed @ FediForum June 2025: Unconferences, Demos, and Community Feedback</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/05-fediforum-recap/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just wrapped up an amazing FediForum June 2025 a week ago, and BadgeFed was right in the thick of it! Here’s a recap of what we did, what we learned, and what’s next for decentralized badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;badgefed-at-fediforum-unconferences--speed-demos&#34;&gt;BadgeFed at FediForum: Unconferences &amp;amp; Speed Demos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BadgeFed had the honor of presenting and hosting &lt;strong&gt;two unconference sessions&lt;/strong&gt; and showing off our work in &lt;strong&gt;one speed demo slots&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TBJpaqZ7Ng&#34;&gt;watch the demo&lt;/a&gt;). The energy was fantastic; lots of curiosity, sharp questions, and a real hunger for open standards in the credentialing space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We just wrapped up an amazing FediForum June 2025 a week ago, and BadgeFed was right in the thick of it! Here’s a recap of what we did, what we learned, and what’s next for decentralized badges.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="badgefed-at-fediforum-unconferences--speed-demos">BadgeFed at FediForum: Unconferences &amp; Speed Demos</h2>
<p>BadgeFed had the honor of presenting and hosting <strong>two unconference sessions</strong> and showing off our work in <strong>one speed demo slots</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TBJpaqZ7Ng">watch the demo</a>). The energy was fantastic; lots of curiosity, sharp questions, and a real hunger for open standards in the credentialing space.</p>
<h2 id="community-feedback-standards-docs-and-openness">Community Feedback: Standards, Docs, and Openness</h2>
<p>A big theme at FediForum was <strong>specs and open standards</strong>. We’re right there with you! That’s why we’ve enhanced our <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/blob/main/DETAILS.md">technical documentation</a> to explain exactly how BadgeFed uses <strong>ActivityPub</strong> and <strong>OpenBadges</strong> together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issuers are ActivityPub actors</strong>, each instance can federate and follow others.</li>
<li><strong>Badges are ActivityPub Notes</strong> with OpenBadge 2.1 attachments for maximum compatibility and verifiability.</li>
<li><strong>Strict linking</strong> between issuer and badge, and between badge and recipient, to prevent spoofing.</li>
<li><strong>Signature validation</strong> for both ActivityPub and OpenBadge data.</li>
<li><strong>Federation</strong>: badges propagate via follows, and a special announcer actor helps with discoverability.</li>
<li><strong>Comments and interactions</strong>: badges can be discussed and shared across the Fediverse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more in our <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/blob/main/DETAILS.md">DETAILS.md</a>.</p>
<h2 id="making-badgefed-easier-to-try">Making BadgeFed Easier to Try</h2>
<p>We heard you: people want to try BadgeFed! Right now, it’s a solo setup (one admin, one Docker container), but we’re working hard to make it easier for others to deploy, configure, and even federate their own instances. Stay tuned for updates on multi-admin support and streamlined onboarding.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-discoverability-vs-spam">Feedback: Discoverability vs. Spam</h2>
<p>One of the most important pieces of feedback we received was about <strong>badge discoverability vs. timeline spam</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/issues/11">see the issue</a>). We want badges to be easy to find and share, but we also don’t want to flood the Fediverse with unwanted posts. This is now our <strong>top priority</strong>, we’re rethinking how verbose BadgeFed should be, and exploring opt-in/opt-out models for badge visibility and hashtag use.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-embedding--profile-badges">What’s Next: Embedding &amp; Profile Badges</h2>
<p>We’re also working on ways to let you <strong>embed badges in your blog</strong> or <strong>add them to your Mastodon profile</strong>. More news on that soon!</p>
<hr>
<p>FediForum was a fantastic experience, huge thanks to everyone who attended, gave feedback, and showed interest in decentralized credentials. Let’s keep building a more open, verifiable, and user-empowered Fediverse!</p>
<p>Badge up, and see you in the timeline! 🏅</p>

      <title>BadgeFed: Early Decentralization Experiments &#43; OpenBadges Export! - Second April 2025 Update</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/04-april2nd-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/04-april2nd-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;br&gt;
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-bits-of-decentralization&#34;&gt;Early Bits of Decentralization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re planning to add &lt;strong&gt;two more test instances&lt;/strong&gt; to push federation further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said—&lt;strong&gt;there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting&lt;/strong&gt; yet. So we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the wild west).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋<br>
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="early-bits-of-decentralization">Early Bits of Decentralization</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&rsquo;re planning to add <strong>two more test instances</strong> to push federation further.</p>
<p>That said—<strong>there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting</strong> yet. So we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&rsquo;t ready for the wild west).</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>—if you&rsquo;re comfortable around <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>, <strong>don&rsquo;t mind losing data</strong>, and want to help us test the early messy bits, <strong>let us know</strong>! We&rsquo;d love to have more fearless testers on board.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="openbadges-export-is-live-">OpenBadges Export is Live! 🎉</h2>
<p>Big milestone: <strong>you can now export your badges to OpenBadges format!</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge step toward real portability. Right now, you can only export badges tied to <strong>profile URLs</strong> (think Mastodon profiles, etc.), <em>not emails</em> yet.</p>
<p>That means you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> directly import them into platforms like <strong>Badgr</strong> or <strong>Credly</strong> (unless they someday support URL-based verification).<br>
We&rsquo;re going to push for that—because identity shouldn&rsquo;t be chained to an email address.</p>
<p>Also: <strong>we have zero interest in storing emails</strong>. Privacy first. Always.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="uxui-improvements--search-">UX/UI Improvements + Search 🔍</h2>
<p>A few small but mighty improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New search page</strong>! Now you can search your past badges easily.</li>
<li><strong>Badges are now an attachment to a regular ActivityPub note</strong>, instead of a separate document type.
<ul>
<li>We tried doing a new document type, but&hellip; <em>Mastodon just ignored it.</em></li>
<li>Like it or not, we need to be Mastodon-compatible to reach people. But attachments are a <strong>fine</strong> way to extend the ActivityPub spec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Little things, but they add up to a smoother experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-other-issuers-and-bridgefed">Follow Other Issuers! (and Bridgefed!)</h2>
<p>Issuers can now <strong>follow other issuers</strong>!<br>
We think this is a critical building block for decentralization. 🛠️</p>
<p>Plus, if you follow <strong>Bridgy Fed</strong>, it will <strong>bridge to Bluesky</strong>!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lots-of-other-nerdy-bits">Lots of Other Nerdy Bits</h2>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of minor improvements and cleanups</li>
<li>More internal support for federating badges across different servers</li>
<li>Prepping groundwork for instance-level controls later</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="wanna-test-with-us-">Wanna Test With Us? 🧪</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw SQL</li>
<li>Servers crashing</li>
<li>Maybe losing everything 😅</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and want to help shape early decentralized BadgeFed, <strong>message us</strong>!</p>
<p>(Seriously, it&rsquo;ll be messy but fun.)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make federated badges a reality. 🚀</p>
