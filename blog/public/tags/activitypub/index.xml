      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been quiet… but not idle. Forget waiting for long blog posts, time for micro updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a few BadgeFed instances live and federating! 🏅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it happen, we did a hardcore backend rewrite to support &lt;strong&gt;multiple domains on a single machine&lt;/strong&gt;.
For most, it&amp;rsquo;s a niche cost-saving move, but it might be useful for others too. Under the hood: each domain runs its own SQLite DB, with backups in place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been quiet… but not idle. Forget waiting for long blog posts, time for micro updates.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s news:</p>
<p>We’ve got a few BadgeFed instances live and federating! 🏅</p>
<p>To make it happen, we did a hardcore backend rewrite to support <strong>multiple domains on a single machine</strong>.
For most, it&rsquo;s a niche cost-saving move, but it might be useful for others too. Under the hood: each domain runs its own SQLite DB, with backups in place.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just about the tech, the fun part is seeing multiple BadgeFed servers talking to each other (!!). Follow them, check the thread, boost it, and watch for more as they come online!</p>

      <title>BadgeFed @ FediForum June 2025: Unconferences, Demos, and Community Feedback</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/05-fediforum-recap/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just wrapped up an amazing FediForum June 2025 a week ago, and BadgeFed was right in the thick of it! Here’s a recap of what we did, what we learned, and what’s next for decentralized badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;badgefed-at-fediforum-unconferences--speed-demos&#34;&gt;BadgeFed at FediForum: Unconferences &amp;amp; Speed Demos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BadgeFed had the honor of presenting and hosting &lt;strong&gt;two unconference sessions&lt;/strong&gt; and showing off our work in &lt;strong&gt;one speed demo slots&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TBJpaqZ7Ng&#34;&gt;watch the demo&lt;/a&gt;). The energy was fantastic; lots of curiosity, sharp questions, and a real hunger for open standards in the credentialing space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋</p>
<p>We just wrapped up an amazing FediForum June 2025 a week ago, and BadgeFed was right in the thick of it! Here’s a recap of what we did, what we learned, and what’s next for decentralized badges.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="badgefed-at-fediforum-unconferences--speed-demos">BadgeFed at FediForum: Unconferences &amp; Speed Demos</h2>
<p>BadgeFed had the honor of presenting and hosting <strong>two unconference sessions</strong> and showing off our work in <strong>one speed demo slots</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TBJpaqZ7Ng">watch the demo</a>). The energy was fantastic; lots of curiosity, sharp questions, and a real hunger for open standards in the credentialing space.</p>
<h2 id="community-feedback-standards-docs-and-openness">Community Feedback: Standards, Docs, and Openness</h2>
<p>A big theme at FediForum was <strong>specs and open standards</strong>. We’re right there with you! That’s why we’ve enhanced our <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/blob/main/DETAILS.md">technical documentation</a> to explain exactly how BadgeFed uses <strong>ActivityPub</strong> and <strong>OpenBadges</strong> together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issuers are ActivityPub actors</strong>, each instance can federate and follow others.</li>
<li><strong>Badges are ActivityPub Notes</strong> with OpenBadge 2.1 attachments for maximum compatibility and verifiability.</li>
<li><strong>Strict linking</strong> between issuer and badge, and between badge and recipient, to prevent spoofing.</li>
<li><strong>Signature validation</strong> for both ActivityPub and OpenBadge data.</li>
<li><strong>Federation</strong>: badges propagate via follows, and a special announcer actor helps with discoverability.</li>
<li><strong>Comments and interactions</strong>: badges can be discussed and shared across the Fediverse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more in our <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/blob/main/DETAILS.md">DETAILS.md</a>.</p>
<h2 id="making-badgefed-easier-to-try">Making BadgeFed Easier to Try</h2>
<p>We heard you: people want to try BadgeFed! Right now, it’s a solo setup (one admin, one Docker container), but we’re working hard to make it easier for others to deploy, configure, and even federate their own instances. Stay tuned for updates on multi-admin support and streamlined onboarding.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-discoverability-vs-spam">Feedback: Discoverability vs. Spam</h2>
<p>One of the most important pieces of feedback we received was about <strong>badge discoverability vs. timeline spam</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed/issues/11">see the issue</a>). We want badges to be easy to find and share, but we also don’t want to flood the Fediverse with unwanted posts. This is now our <strong>top priority</strong>, we’re rethinking how verbose BadgeFed should be, and exploring opt-in/opt-out models for badge visibility and hashtag use.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-embedding--profile-badges">What’s Next: Embedding &amp; Profile Badges</h2>
<p>We’re also working on ways to let you <strong>embed badges in your blog</strong> or <strong>add them to your Mastodon profile</strong>. More news on that soon!</p>
<hr>
<p>FediForum was a fantastic experience, huge thanks to everyone who attended, gave feedback, and showed interest in decentralized credentials. Let’s keep building a more open, verifiable, and user-empowered Fediverse!</p>
<p>Badge up, and see you in the timeline! 🏅</p>

      <title>BadgeFed: Early Decentralization Experiments &#43; OpenBadges Export! - Second April 2025 Update</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/04-april2nd-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/04-april2nd-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;br&gt;
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-bits-of-decentralization&#34;&gt;Early Bits of Decentralization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re planning to add &lt;strong&gt;two more test instances&lt;/strong&gt; to push federation further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said—&lt;strong&gt;there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting&lt;/strong&gt; yet. So we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the wild west).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋<br>
Two weeks have passed and here we have another update from the BadgeFed burrow!
Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new, brewing, and how you can jump in if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="early-bits-of-decentralization">Early Bits of Decentralization</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started the very first steps toward decentralization! 🛰️
Right now, we&rsquo;re planning to add <strong>two more test instances</strong> to push federation further.</p>
<p>That said—<strong>there are still no controls for blocking, defederating, moderating, or deleting</strong> yet. So we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> opening it up publicly just yet (BadgeFed isn&rsquo;t ready for the wild west).</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>—if you&rsquo;re comfortable around <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>, <strong>don&rsquo;t mind losing data</strong>, and want to help us test the early messy bits, <strong>let us know</strong>! We&rsquo;d love to have more fearless testers on board.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="openbadges-export-is-live-">OpenBadges Export is Live! 🎉</h2>
<p>Big milestone: <strong>you can now export your badges to OpenBadges format!</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge step toward real portability. Right now, you can only export badges tied to <strong>profile URLs</strong> (think Mastodon profiles, etc.), <em>not emails</em> yet.</p>
<p>That means you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> directly import them into platforms like <strong>Badgr</strong> or <strong>Credly</strong> (unless they someday support URL-based verification).<br>
We&rsquo;re going to push for that—because identity shouldn&rsquo;t be chained to an email address.</p>
<p>Also: <strong>we have zero interest in storing emails</strong>. Privacy first. Always.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="uxui-improvements--search-">UX/UI Improvements + Search 🔍</h2>
<p>A few small but mighty improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New search page</strong>! Now you can search your past badges easily.</li>
<li><strong>Badges are now an attachment to a regular ActivityPub note</strong>, instead of a separate document type.
<ul>
<li>We tried doing a new document type, but&hellip; <em>Mastodon just ignored it.</em></li>
<li>Like it or not, we need to be Mastodon-compatible to reach people. But attachments are a <strong>fine</strong> way to extend the ActivityPub spec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Little things, but they add up to a smoother experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-other-issuers-and-bridgefed">Follow Other Issuers! (and Bridgefed!)</h2>
<p>Issuers can now <strong>follow other issuers</strong>!<br>
We think this is a critical building block for decentralization. 🛠️</p>
<p>Plus, if you follow <strong>Bridgy Fed</strong>, it will <strong>bridge to Bluesky</strong>!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lots-of-other-nerdy-bits">Lots of Other Nerdy Bits</h2>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of minor improvements and cleanups</li>
<li>More internal support for federating badges across different servers</li>
<li>Prepping groundwork for instance-level controls later</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="wanna-test-with-us-">Wanna Test With Us? 🧪</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw SQL</li>
<li>Servers crashing</li>
<li>Maybe losing everything 😅</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and want to help shape early decentralized BadgeFed, <strong>message us</strong>!</p>
<p>(Seriously, it&rsquo;ll be messy but fun.)</p>

      <title>BadgeFed Grows Up (a Little) - April 2025 Update</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/03-april-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:27:54 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse! 👋&lt;br&gt;
Big news—BadgeFed is officially growing out of its prototype phase. This is your periodic (weekly? monthly? vibes-based?) update on what’s new, what’s brewing, and what we need help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-badges-real-people&#34;&gt;Real Badges, Real People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve issued around &lt;strong&gt;25 badges&lt;/strong&gt;—our first batch we consider &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;! 🎉&lt;br&gt;
Out of those, about 10 were accepted. Folks who accepted should’ve received a private notification. If you didn’t, check your inbox or let us know!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse! 👋<br>
Big news—BadgeFed is officially growing out of its prototype phase. This is your periodic (weekly? monthly? vibes-based?) update on what’s new, what’s brewing, and what we need help with.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="real-badges-real-people">Real Badges, Real People</h2>
<p>We’ve issued around <strong>25 badges</strong>—our first batch we consider <em>real</em>! 🎉<br>
Out of those, about 10 were accepted. Folks who accepted should’ve received a private notification. If you didn’t, check your inbox or let us know!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="admin-auth-hashtags--ux-glow-up">Admin Auth, Hashtags &amp; UX Glow-Up</h2>
<p>We added authentication for the admin panel!<br>
Right now, you’ll need to set up a Mastodon server and a unique admin user. That account will manage everything: badges, actors, and more.</p>
<p>We also added <strong>hashtag support</strong>! So badges now show up properly across the fediverse with their tags.<br>
Huge shoutout to <a href="https://dotnet.social/@SmartmanApps">@SmartmanApps@dotnet.social</a>—this one’s for you! And thanks for the reminder: hashtags really are the backbone of fediverse discoverability.</p>
<p>On the visual side—we gave the UI some love! It’s starting to feel like something we’re proud of. If you’re into CSS or design, we’d <em>love</em> to collaborate.</p>
<p>We’re inching toward a private beta launch. Just trying to avoid any irreversible DB/spec changes before opening the doors. (We’ve already nuked the whole database a few times&hellip; classic early days.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="federation--future-thinking">Federation &amp; Future Thinking</h2>
<p>We’re still figuring out federation, we have already a few ideas to implement it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re deep in the weeds of the OpenBadges spec and slowly building out ActivityPub updates (like actor updates, more robust object flows, etc.).</p>
<p>We also started poking at what interop with <strong>at-proto (aka Bluesky)</strong> might look like. We’re skeptical, but curious. If you’ve got thoughts, we’re all ears.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tech-notes--nerdy-bits">Tech Notes &amp; Nerdy Bits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still using <strong>SQLite</strong>—haven’t made the jump to PostgreSQL yet.</li>
<li>We added a (very alpha) settings option to download your DB and run raw SQL. It’s powerful&hellip; and risky. Use with care.</li>
<li>Exploring the idea of <strong>one SQLite DB per actor</strong>, so identities and records can be portable across servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh—and we finally squashed that annoying cache issue showing old badges.<br>
Huge thanks to <a href="https://stefanbohacek.online/@stefan">Stefan Bohacek</a> for the report. We made the badge note ID actually unique now. 🙃</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bug-fixes--shoutouts">Bug Fixes &amp; Shoutouts</h2>
<p>Massive props to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitra.social/@silverpill"><strong>Silver Pill</strong></a> for reporting an issue when following an issuer/actor.</li>
<li><a href="https://a11y.social/@dankeck"><strong>Dan Keck</strong></a> for the awesome a11y PR that added alt-text to badges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep ‘em coming—we appreciate every bug report and contribution.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next-">What’s Next? 📅</h2>
<p>We’re heads-down on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federation polish</li>
<li>Better actor management</li>
<li>OpenBadges support</li>
<li>Prepping for private beta</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an open-source project. If you&rsquo;re into decentralization, badges, identity, or just weird fun tech—<strong>jump in</strong>. Feedback, PRs, issue ideas, and vibes are all welcome.</p>

      <title>BadgeFed: From Prototype to Reality</title>
      <link>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/02-roadmap/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:27:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://badgefed.vocalcat.com/post/02-roadmap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Fediverse, we&amp;rsquo;ve got some exciting news—BadgeFed is moving out of the prototype phase! That&amp;rsquo;s right, what started as a scrappy proof-of-concept is now becoming a real, structured, and (dare we say) polished federated badge system.
And since we believe in working out in the open, we want to share our roadmap with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-three-priorities-&#34;&gt;The Big Three Priorities 🏆&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re focusing on three major areas to take BadgeFed from &amp;ldquo;hey, this kinda works&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;oh wow, this is actually usable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Fediverse, we&rsquo;ve got some exciting news—BadgeFed is moving out of the prototype phase! That&rsquo;s right, what started as a scrappy proof-of-concept is now becoming a real, structured, and (dare we say) polished federated badge system.
And since we believe in working out in the open, we want to share our roadmap with you.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-three-priorities-">The Big Three Priorities 🏆</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re focusing on three major areas to take BadgeFed from &ldquo;hey, this kinda works&rdquo; to &ldquo;oh wow, this is actually usable.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="1-authentication-">1. Authentication 🔐</h3>
<p>Right now, logging in is a bit of a mess. So we&rsquo;re tackling authentication properly, integrating OAuth so you can log in using your Mastodon (or other Fediverse) account.
We&rsquo;re building this with .NET and Blazor because performance and scalability matter. Plus, no one wants to manage yet another username/password combo.</p>
<h3 id="2-federation--spec-">2. Federation &amp; Spec 🌍</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re making sure BadgeFed speaks ActivityPub fluently. Right now, federation kinda-sorta works, but we need to define a proper spec that makes badge issuing,
earning, and verification seamless across different platforms. Whether you&rsquo;re on Mastodon, Pleroma, or something else entirely, BadgeFed should just work.
We&rsquo;re ironing out the kinks so badges travel as smoothly as your cat pictures. Also we want to support export and import from OpenBadges spec, and we need to do some experimentation on how this could travel on the fediverse.</p>
<h3 id="3-packaging-docs-and-docker-">3. Packaging, Docs, and Docker 📦</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s cooler than a decentralized badge system? A decentralized badge system that&rsquo;s easy to set up.
We&rsquo;re working on clear documentation, making installation painless, and putting together a Docker container so you don&rsquo;t have to wrestle with dependencies or even dotnet.
One command, and boom—you&rsquo;re federating badges like a pro.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-would-be-nice-priorities-">The &ldquo;Would Be Nice&rdquo; Priorities ✨</h2>
<p>Once the big three are solid, we&rsquo;re setting our sights on some much-needed improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approval Process &amp; Expiration</strong> – Not all badges should last forever. We&rsquo;re adding controls for expiration dates and approval workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Stats &amp; Insights</strong> – Want to see how many people are earning badges? We&rsquo;ll be adding analytics to track adoption and engagement.</li>
<li><strong>CSS &amp; UI/UX Love</strong> – Let&rsquo;s be honest, the prototype is functional, but it&rsquo;s not winning any beauty contests. Expect smoother UI, better mobile support, and fewer &ldquo;why is this button here?&rdquo; moments.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong> – BadgeFed deserves a proper introduction. A clean, informative landing page is in the works.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next-">What&rsquo;s Next? 📅</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re heads-down working on these priorities, but as always, feedback, ideas, and contributions are welcome.
This is an open-source project, and the best way to make sure it fits the needs of the Fediverse is to have the community involved.</p>
<p>If you want to help, hop into our discussions, check out the repo at <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed">https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed</a>, or just share your thoughts. Let&rsquo;s make federated badges a thing! 🏅</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of digital credentials, we’ve seen centralized platforms like Credly dominate the badge and certification space.
But what if we could flip the script? What if badges could be decentralized, self-certified, and issued directly by organizations in the Fediverse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reusing the social graph already present in the Fediverse, we can enable a seamless integration of badges into the networks people are already part of.
Instead of creating new, siloed systems for certification, we can utilize the trusted connections and relationships within platforms like Mastodon to issue and verify badges.
It’s about making the credentialing process as decentralized and open as the social interactions we have online today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what if we could flip the script? What if badges could be decentralized, self-certified, and issued directly by organizations in the Fediverse?</p>
<p>By reusing the social graph already present in the Fediverse, we can enable a seamless integration of badges into the networks people are already part of.
Instead of creating new, siloed systems for certification, we can utilize the trusted connections and relationships within platforms like Mastodon to issue and verify badges.
It’s about making the credentialing process as decentralized and open as the social interactions we have online today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m working on with my latest project: a minimalistic ActivityPub implementation for badges, built using #dotnet.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-badge-systems">The Problem with Traditional Badge Systems</h2>
<p>It’s mind-blowing that major organizations—think Microsoft, Non-Profits, and educational institutions—spend thousands of dollars on badge providers like Pearson just to get a &ldquo;verified&rdquo; badge.
These badges, while useful, are locked into centralized platforms that limit the potential for genuine, open verification systems.</p>
<p>What if badges could be as decentralized as social media profiles? Imagine organizations running their own badge systems—similar to the way social media instances like Mastodon operate in the Fediverse.
Think about a domain-based badge system like <code>badges.mozilla.com</code>, or a school district offering badges at <code>certifications.myschooldistrict.com</code>. Even a podcast could issue badges to its guests, with the entire verification happening directly within the domain.</p>
<h2 id="why-activitypub">Why ActivityPub?</h2>
<p>ActivityPub is already a powerful protocol for secure, decentralized communication between actors in the Fediverse.
It enables us to create verifiable interactions and sign digital artifacts in a way that was previously the domain of a few centralized certificate authorities.
With ActivityPub, we can extend this to badges, allowing people and organizations to interact with verified credentials in the same decentralized way that we share posts,
follows, and interactions across Mastodon or any other Fediverse platform.</p>
<p>Think about how LetsEncrypt disrupted the centralized SSL certificate market. Now, with a decentralized badge system, we can enable a similar revolution for verified credentials.</p>
<h2 id="the-project-so-far">The Project So Far</h2>
<p>I’ve made some solid progress, and there’s now a functional proof of concept (PoC) in place. The project is live and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/tryvocalcat/activitypub-badges">ActivityPub Badges on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This fediverse actor, the badges issuer, isn’t a Mastodon instance, a Pleroma, or a blog—it’s an actor in a badge system. You can follow it on Mastodon, but its badges are not microblogging notes.
Instead, think of it as a way to display verified credentials directly from a decentralized source.</p>
<p>Here’s the first badge I’ve issued:</p>
<p><a href="https://badges.vocalcat.com/record/10">First Badge: View on Mastodon</a></p>
<p>Simply copy and paste the URL and open it in your Mastodon client. The badge will show up as a note, and you can celebrate, comment, or share it within your ActivityPub network.
This is how the badge system will work—just like social media, but with credentials!</p>
<h2 id="a-decentralized-future-for-badges">A Decentralized Future for Badges</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal is to create a decentralized badge system where different instances of badge issuers will recognize each other’s certifications.
This way, even if a certificate issuer disappears, the credential is still secure and verifiable across the network.
Imagine the survivability of certificates in such a system—if your issuer disappears, the credential still exists in a federated, decentralized space.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting future, and I’m just getting started. If you want to learn more about the progress of this project, follow me, or check out the GitHub repo. (Btw, I am not a Mastodon account, or a BadgeFed system, I am a static site).</p>
<p>Let’s create a future where verification is decentralized, secure, and open for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="early-adopter-badge-who-wants-one">Early Adopter Badge: Who Wants One?</h2>
<p>As with any new project, there’s always room for early adopters. If you’re interested in getting your own badge, let me know! Follow the progress and get involved as we continue to build this decentralized badge system.</p>
