  "content": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the ever-evolving world of digital credentials, we\u2019ve seen centralized platforms like Credly dominate the badge and certification space.\nBut what if we could flip the script? What if badges could be decentralized, self-certified, and issued directly by organizations in the Fediverse?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy reusing the social graph already present in the Fediverse, we can enable a seamless integration of badges into the networks people are already part of.\nInstead of creating new, siloed systems for certification, we can utilize the trusted connections and relationships within platforms like Mastodon to issue and verify badges.\nIt\u2019s about making the credentialing process as decentralized and open as the social interactions we have online today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m working on with my latest project: a minimalistic ActivityPub implementation for badges, built using #dotnet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\u0022the-problem-with-traditional-badge-systems\u0022\u003EThe Problem with Traditional Badge Systems\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s mind-blowing that major organizations\u2014think Microsoft, Non-Profits, and educational institutions\u2014spend thousands of dollars on badge providers like Pearson just to get a \u0026ldquo;verified\u0026rdquo; badge.\nThese badges, while useful, are locked into centralized platforms that limit the potential for genuine, open verification systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if badges could be as decentralized as social media profiles? Imagine organizations running their own badge systems\u2014similar to the way social media instances like Mastodon operate in the Fediverse.\nThink about a domain-based badge system like \u003Ccode\u003Ebadges.mozilla.com\u003C/code\u003E, or a school district offering badges at \u003Ccode\u003Ecertifications.myschooldistrict.com\u003C/code\u003E. Even a podcast could issue badges to its guests, with the entire verification happening directly within the domain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\u0022why-activitypub\u0022\u003EWhy ActivityPub?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EActivityPub is already a powerful protocol for secure, decentralized communication between actors in the Fediverse.\nIt enables us to create verifiable interactions and sign digital artifacts in a way that was previously the domain of a few centralized certificate authorities.\nWith ActivityPub, we can extend this to badges, allowing people and organizations to interact with verified credentials in the same decentralized way that we share posts,\nfollows, and interactions across Mastodon or any other Fediverse platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about how LetsEncrypt disrupted the centralized SSL certificate market. Now, with a decentralized badge system, we can enable a similar revolution for verified credentials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\u0022the-project-so-far\u0022\u003EThe Project So Far\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u2019ve made some solid progress, and there\u2019s now a functional proof of concept (PoC) in place. The project is live and can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/tryvocalcat/activitypub-badges\u0022\u003EActivityPub Badges on GitHub\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis fediverse actor, the badges issuer, isn\u2019t a Mastodon instance, a Pleroma, or a blog\u2014it\u2019s an actor in a badge system. You can follow it on Mastodon, but its badges are not microblogging notes.\nInstead, think of it as a way to display verified credentials directly from a decentralized source.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u2019s the first badge I\u2019ve issued:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://badges.vocalcat.com/record/10\u0022\u003EFirst Badge: View on Mastodon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply copy and paste the URL and open it in your Mastodon client. The badge will show up as a note, and you can celebrate, comment, or share it within your ActivityPub network.\nThis is how the badge system will work\u2014just like social media, but with credentials!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\u0022a-decentralized-future-for-badges\u0022\u003EA Decentralized Future for Badges\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate goal is to create a decentralized badge system where different instances of badge issuers will recognize each other\u2019s certifications.\nThis way, even if a certificate issuer disappears, the credential is still secure and verifiable across the network.\nImagine the survivability of certificates in such a system\u2014if your issuer disappears, the credential still exists in a federated, decentralized space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s an exciting future, and I\u2019m just getting started.

(Btw, I am not a Mastodon account, or a BadgeFed system, I am a static site).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s create a future where verification is decentralized, secure, and open for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\u0022early-adopter-badge-who-wants-one\u0022\u003EEarly Adopter Badge: Who Wants One?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with any new project, there\u2019s always room for early adopters.
