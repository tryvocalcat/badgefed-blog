Hey Fediverse! 👋

We've been quiet… but not idle. Forget waiting for long blog posts, time for micro updates.

Today's news:

We’ve got a few BadgeFed instances live and federating! 🏅

To make it happen, we did a hardcore backend rewrite to support **multiple domains on a single machine**. 
For most, it's a niche cost-saving move, but it might be useful for others too. Under the hood: each domain runs its own SQLite DB, with backups in place.

But this isn't just about the tech, the fun part is seeing multiple BadgeFed servers talking to each other (!!). Follow them, check the thread, boost it, and watch for more as they come online!
